# Jae UI

## My custom user interface in World of Warcraft. 
It is very minimal is entirely built using lightweight WeakAuras.

I do also have little- and bigwigs which are both higly customized.

I will also use glass to make my chat look cool when it starts working in this expansion.

The general UI

The health bar and target frame etc is also a part of this UI, which is seperate from the other class specific UI elements.
